# Sports-Statistics
My idea for a program based on Python will allow a user to scrape sports statistics off of multiple different websites. Some of the various sports include football, baseball, basketball, hockey and others. The program is designed to be created by two people. One person will work on integrating the databases while the other will work on the code that access the databases and the various commands. Some of the websites that we may grab data from includes http://scorespro.com/, http://pro-football-reference.com/, http://baseball-reference.com/, http://basketball-reference.com/, and http://hockey-reference.com/. These websites will ensure that our program has accurate and up-to-date statistics no matter when a user wants to use our program.  Users of the software will be able to use a variety of different commands in order to access different types of statistics within our program. Sports Statistics needs to have a large amount of accessible data, but it also needs to be user friendly. We will ensure that it will be user friendly by designing the code to display the program in a logical format. This format is based on what the user wants to know first, and then what they want to see after that. We will not overload the user with unnecessary program elements on the screen.
